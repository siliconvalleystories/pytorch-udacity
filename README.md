1. cnn_visualizations.ipynb - demonstrates how to create a CNN with planned weights for the filters, how to return both the pre and post activation scores from the conv layer, visualizes both the images and the filters thus helping to understand how the vertical and the horizontal edge detection happens based on the kind of filter being chosen. A real CNN will off course tune the weights of the filters on its own, but this is a great demonstration using pre-planned weights to see the outputs
   of the intermediate hidden layers.
